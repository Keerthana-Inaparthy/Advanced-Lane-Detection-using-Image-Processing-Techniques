The Lane Detection System is used to identify lane boundaries and providing real-time feedback, including audio alert about the next turn to be taken.Â 
The system utilizes image preprocessing techniques, including:
Camera Calibration to correct lens distortions
Thresholding to isolate lane lines
Perspective Transformation to provide a bird's-eye view
Lane Lines Detection through Sliding Window and Polynomial Fit algorithms.
